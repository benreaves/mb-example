Demonstration comparing Metabob and Copilot

To try it, please
* git clone this repo main branch (git clone https://github.com/benreaves/mb-example )
* cd src
* python get-mfcc.py

You will see an error on line 14, whose root cause is from line 8: the return value order is wrong. We got line 7 and 8 from Copilot.

Furthermore, look at the printout from line 10. That looks like a stereo wav, not a sampling frequency!

Next, try
```
python using-librosa.py
```

I like librosa because it can read more file formats including mp3, and it is commonly used for extracting parameters such as MFCC. But MFCC are not meaningful on stereo input, which watermelon.wav is, so in line 38 I want to blend the left and right channel if it was stereo, which ../data/watermelon.py is. Try it out.

You'll get an error at line 38. That line was generated by copilot. It didn't know that, at line 33, librosa already gave us mono, it already did the conversion for us. Did metabob know that?
